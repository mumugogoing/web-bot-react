# Login System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the login system integrated with the gin-web backend, following the architecture from gin-web-vue.

## Files Created

### 1. src/api/auth/index.ts
- Login API (`POST /base/login`)
- Logout API (`POST /base/logout`)
- Get user info API (`POST /user/info`)
- Refresh token API (`POST /base/refreshToken`)
- Get captcha API (`GET /base/captcha`)
- Check user status API (`GET /base/user/status`)

### 2. src/utils/cookies.ts
- Token management utilities
- `getToken()`: Retrieve JWT token from localStorage
- `setToken()`: Save JWT token to localStorage
- `removeToken()`: Clear JWT token

### 3. src/views/login/index.tsx
- Full-featured login page with:
  - Username/password form
  - Captcha support (shows when needed based on user status)
  - Pre-filled test credentials (super/123456)
  - Redirect after successful login
  - Beautiful gradient background
  - Responsive design with Ant Design components

## Files Modified

### 1. src/utils/request.ts
- Updated to use proper TypeScript types (`InternalAxiosRequestConfig`)
- Added JWT token injection in request headers
- Implemented automatic token refresh on 401 errors
- Added request queue to handle concurrent requests during token refresh
- Auto-redirect to login page on authentication failure

### 2. src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
- Complete rewrite to integrate with backend
- Added state management for:
  - `isAuthenticated`: Login status
  - `isLoading`: Initial auth check loading state
  - `userInfo`: Full user information from backend
  - `role`: Mapped frontend role
- Implemented functions:
  - `login()`: Authenticate user with backend
  - `logout()`: Clear session and redirect
  - `fetchUserInfo()`: Get current user data
  - `mapBackendRoleToFrontend()`: Map backend roles to frontend roles
- Role mapping:
  - `super` → `admin`
  - `admin` → `admin`
  - `user` → `user`
  - `guest` → `guest`

### 3. src/components/Navigation.tsx
- Removed manual role selector
- Added login/logout buttons
- Display user information (username and role)
- User dropdown menu with logout option
- Conditional rendering based on authentication status

### 4. src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
- Added loading spinner while checking auth status
- Redirect to login page for unauthenticated users
- Save intended destination for redirect after login
- Show different messages for "not logged in" vs "insufficient permissions"

### 5. src/router/index.tsx
- Added `/login` route
- Updated protected routes:
  - `/monitor` requires ADMIN role (for super users)
  - `/stacks` requires ADMIN role (for super users)
  - `/swap` requires USER role

### 6. src/types/auth.ts
- Added interfaces:
  - `UserInfo`: User profile data
  - `LoginForm`: Login request data
  - `CaptchaInfo`: Captcha image and ID

### 7. README.md
- Comprehensive documentation of login system
- API integration details
- Role mapping explanation
- Usage instructions with test credentials
- Updated project structure
- Environment configuration guide

## Key Features

### 1. JWT Token Management
- Tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic injection in API request headers
- Automatic refresh when expired
- Clear token on logout or refresh failure

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- Backend roles mapped to frontend roles
- Super users have admin access to Starknet/Stacks monitoring
- Protected routes enforce authentication
- Graceful handling of insufficient permissions

### 3. User Experience
- Beautiful login page with gradient background
- Loading states during authentication
- Success/error messages using Ant Design
- Redirect to intended page after login
- User info display in navigation
- One-click logout

### 4. Security Features
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Token refresh mechanism
- Request queue during token refresh (prevents duplicate refresh requests)
- Automatic logout on authentication failure
- Captcha support for enhanced security

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Homepage displays login button when not authenticated
2. ✅ Clicking login button navigates to login page
3. ✅ Login page displays with pre-filled credentials
4. ✅ Accessing protected routes while not logged in shows "需要登录" (Login Required)
5. ✅ Navigation correctly shows login/logout based on auth status

## Backend Requirements

The frontend expects the following gin-web backend endpoints:

- `POST /base/login` - Accepts username, password, captchaId, captchaAnswer
- `POST /base/logout` - Logs out current user
- `POST /base/refreshToken` - Refreshes JWT token
- `GET /base/user/status?username={username}` - Returns user status and captcha if needed
- `GET /base/captcha` - Returns captcha image and ID
- `POST /user/info` - Returns current user information including roles

All responses should follow the format:
```json
{
  "code": 201,
  "data": { ... },
  "msg": "success"
}
```

## Notes

1. The `super` role from the backend is mapped to `admin` role in the frontend, granting access to all features including Starknet and Stacks monitoring.

2. The implementation closely follows the gin-web-vue architecture for consistency.

3. Token refresh is handled automatically and transparently to the user.

4. The system is designed to work seamlessly with the gin-web backend without requiring code changes on the backend.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add "Remember Me" functionality
- Implement password reset flow
- Add user profile management
- Implement session timeout warnings
- Add multi-factor authentication support
- Replicate additional features from gin-web-vue (user management, role management, etc.)
